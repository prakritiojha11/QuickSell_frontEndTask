## ⚡ **Core Features**

### 1. **Dynamic Grouping** 🗂️
The application allows the user to group tickets in **three distinct ways**:
- **By Status**: Group tickets based on their current status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done).
- **By User**: Arrange tickets according to the assigned user.
- **By Priority**: Group tickets based on their priority level.

### 2. **Sorting Options** 🔄
Users can sort the displayed tickets in **two ways**:
- **By Priority**: Arrange tickets in descending order of priority (from Urgent to No Priority).
- **By Title**: Sort tickets alphabetically by title.

### 3. **Priority Levels** 🔥
The API provides priority levels for the tickets, which are categorized as follows:

| Priority Level | Description   |
|----------------|---------------|
| 4              | 🔴 **Urgent** |
| 3              | 🟠 **High**   |
| 2              | 🟡 **Medium** |
| 1              | 🟢 **Low**    |
| 0              | ⚪ **No Priority** |

## 💾 **State Persistence**

The application saves the user's view state (e.g., grouping and sorting preferences) so that even after a page reload, the user's settings are preserved.
